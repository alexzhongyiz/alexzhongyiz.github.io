	<p class="intro">I am a ML and Quant Researcher at a Proprietary trading firm in Chicago. I also worked at Amazon as a Machine Learning Scientist on buyer fraud detection. 
		Prior to that I worked with <a href="https://mathematics.stanford.edu/people/mohammed-abouzaid">Prof. Mohammed Abouzaid</a> on my PhD program at 
		<a href="https://www.math.columbia.edu"/>Columbia University</a> on the topic of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symplectic_geometry">Symplectic Geometry</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homological_mirror_symmetry">Homological Mirror Symmetry</a>.
		
		I went to college at <a href="https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/puremath/">PKU</a> and <a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/math">University of Michigan</a> and did some fun undergrad research on homological algebra with <a href="https://dept.math.lsa.umich.edu/~hochster/">Prof. Mel Hochster</a>.</p>

	<p>My current research interests lie in the intersection of trading, statistics, and machine learning. </p>
